# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV
This repository contains code and resources for performing face detection using the OpenCV library in Python. Face detection is a crucial task in computer vision and has a wide range of applications, including facial recognition, emotion analysis, and human-computer interaction.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x installed on your system

OpenCV library (opencv-python) installed. You can install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-opencv.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd face-detection-opencv
Place the image or video file you want to perform face detection on in the input directory.

Run the face detection script:

css
Copy code
python detect_faces.py --input input/image.jpg
Replace input/image.jpg with the path to your image or video file.

The script will process the input file and display the output with detected faces outlined by rectangles.

Customization
You can customize the behavior of the face detection script by modifying the parameters in the detect_faces.py file. For example, you can adjust the minimum and maximum sizes of the detected faces, the detection confidence threshold, and more.
